  |   WarParty is an old school RTS where players must gather resources     |
  |   to unlock new buildings, units and upgrades, with the goal of         |
  |   destroying all their opponents' bases. Players can also control a     |
  |   powerful chieftain that they can shape by selecting talents when      |
  |   they expand their settlement. These talents also offer new units or   |
  |   bonuses that can change the way players play.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Resources are limited however and the player will need to step out    |
  |   of his base to gather precious resources required for more powerful   |
  |   units, or capture and hold shrines that slowly give them power        |
  |   points used to summon powerful abilities that can turn the tide of    |
  |   battle.                                                               |

  |   They will have to be careful however, as wild dinosaurs and other     |
  |   tribes roam the map.                                                  |
